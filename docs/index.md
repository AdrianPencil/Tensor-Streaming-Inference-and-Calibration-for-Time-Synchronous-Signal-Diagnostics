# SSP Documentation

SSP is a streaming + replay engineering platform for signal-based monitoring:

- event-time correct ingestion and windowing
- deterministic replay/backfill
- early-warning anomaly detection with calibrated false-alarm control
- root-cause localization with contract/invariant signals
- filtering/fusion, prognostics, and forecasting -all sharing one core
